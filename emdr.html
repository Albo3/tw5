            EMDR is a powerful psychotherapy technique that has been very
            successful in helping people who suffer from trauma, anxiety, panic,
            disturbing memories, post traumatic stress and many other emotional
            problems.

            <h2>How was EMDR Developed?</h2>
            <img src="assetsP/shaprio1.webp" alt="Francine Shapiro" class="emdr-img" />
            <p>
              In 1987, an American psychologist, Francine Shapiro, observed that eye movements can reduce the intensity of disturbing thoughts, under certain conditions. She continued to vigorously research this phenomenon and in 1989 reported success using EMDR to treat victims of trauma. After this initial discovery, many treatment studies were carried out and today there are more published treatment outcome studies on EMDR than any other treatment for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.

            <p>
              An EMDR session is quite different to that of a regular
              counselling session. However, as a starting point, it is still
              essential to take a comprehensive history (1-2 sessions) before
              this processing commences. Typically there are eight phases of
              treatment:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>History and Treatment Planning:</strong> (1-2 sessions)
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Preparation:</strong> (1-4 sessions) People with acute
                trauma histories may require more sessions. During this phase
                you will be taught specific techniques to cope with emotional
                disturbance that might arise during processing.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Assessment:</strong> You will select a specific scene or
                picture from the target event that best represents the memory.
                Negative beliefs associated with the event(s) are isolated and
                processed and positive beliefs or preferred beliefs are put
                forward.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Desensitisation:</strong> This phase focuses on any
                disturbing emotions and sensations as they are measured by the
                SUDS (Subjective Units of Discomfort Scale) rating. The aim of
                this phase is to reduce the SUDS to below 2.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Installation:</strong> In this phase the goal is to
                concentrate on and increase the strength of the positive belief
                that you have identified to replace the original negative
                belief.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Body Scan:</strong> Following acceptance of the positive
                belief after it has been strengthened and installed, I will ask
                you to refocus on the original target event and notice whether
                there are any residual feelings of tension in your body. An EMDR
                session isn't considered to be successful until you can bring up
                the original target without feeling any physical tension.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Closure:</strong> I will ensure that you leave the
                session feeling better than you did at the start. I will teach
                you a variety of techniques to help you feel calm and contained.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Re-evaluation:</strong> At the commencement of every new
                session we will check to see whether resolution has been
                maintained. We may need to engage in further processing of
                targets or associated memories if you are still experiencing
                discomfort.
              </li>

            <h2>Who can benefit from EMDR?</h2>
            <p>
              Almost anyone can benefit from EMDR. However, this remarkable
              therapy was originally developed for the resolution of Post
              Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), to help overcome the particular
              set of reactions that can develop in people who have been through
              a traumatic event which threatened their life or safety, or that
              of others around them.
            </p>
            <p>A person with PTSD experiences four main types of problems:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Re-living the traumatic event.</li>
              <li>
                Feeling overly watchful (hypervigilance) or feeling wound up.
              </li>
              <li>Avoiding reminders of the event.</li>
              <li>Feeling emotionally numb.</li>

            <h2>EMDR FAQ</h2>
            <h3>What happens in a session?</h3>
            <p>
              EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing) is different
              for everyone, because the healing process is guided from within. A
              comprehensive history will be taken before memories are targeted
              and processed. Often past issues or memories come up, which are
              related to the current concern.
            </p>
            <h3>Is EMDR hypnosis?</h3>
            <p>
              No it is not. Processing utilises all your own thoughts and you
              are fully awake.
            </p>
            <h3>Will I be in control?</h3>
            <p>
              In EMDR you are always in charge of when to start or stop. You can
              decide how much to tell me about the experience being processed. I
              am on hand as a guide to help keep you on track and to gain
              maximum benefit from the session.
