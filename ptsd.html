            Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition
            that can develop after experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event.
            Understanding PTSD is crucial for effective treatment and recovery.

            <h2>PTSD Symptoms</h2>

            <p>
              People with PTSD may experience feelings of panic or extreme fear,
              similar to the fear they felt during the traumatic experience.
              There are four main areas of difficulty:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Reliving the traumatic event:</strong> You may relive
                the event through recurring and unwanted memories, often in the
                form of vivid images and nightmares. Sometimes you might
                experience intense emotional or physical reactions like heart
                palpitations, or sweating when recalling or being reminded of
                the event.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Feeling wound up or overly alert:</strong> You might
                experience sleeping difficulties, irritability and lack of
                concentration, be startled easily and be constantly on the
                lookout for danger or threats.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Avoiding reminders of the event:</strong> You might go
                out of your way to avoid reminders of the event or any places,
                people, thoughts or feelings associated with it because they
                bring back painful memories.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Feeling emotionally numb:</strong> You might find you
                have lost interest in day-to-day activities, feel cut off and
                detached from friends and family, or feel completely flat or
                emotionally numb â€“ as if your feelings are 'offline.'
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              It is not unusual for people with PTSD to experience other mental
              health problems at the same time. These may have developed
              directly in response to the traumatic event or have followed the
              PTSD. These additional difficulties, most commonly Depression and
              Anxiety and increased drug and alcohol use, are more likely to
              occur if PTSD has persisted for a long time.

          <div class="ptsd-section">
            <h2>Complex Trauma</h2>
            <p>
              Complex trauma is identified by Judith Herman and other leaders in
              the area of Traumatology as "the existence of a complex form of
              PTSD in survivors of prolonged, repeated trauma." (Herman 1992).
            </p>
            <p>
              An example of a history of complex trauma might involve that of a
              female who was adopted at a young age, experienced sexual and/or
              physical abuse in care, experienced ongoing sexual abuse by a
              stepfather and then found herself in a series of abusive
              relationships throughout her teens and early adult life. Here
              there is a history of extensive interpersonal traumas at various
              ages and developmental stages covering a range of categories.
            </p>
            <p>
              When treating people with complex trauma, it is unrealistic to
              think there will be rapid results in just a few sessions. Here, a
              conscious and methodical phased approach in EMDR treatment is
              necessary which may also require a lot of preparation and
              stabilisation.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am cautious and careful when working with complex trauma and
              will be constantly checking in with you to ensure that you are not
              being overwhelmed or engulfed in therapy.
