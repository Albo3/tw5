            <p>
              According to the self-medication hypothesis of substance abuse,
              many people develop addiction problems in an attempt to manage the
              distress associated with the effects of trauma exposure and to
              alleviate traumatic stress symptoms.
            </p>

            <h3>Signs and Symptoms of Addiction</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Using more of the substance than intended or over a long period
                of time.
              </li>
              <li>Having difficulty cutting down on using or quitting.</li>
              <li>Experiencing strong cravings to use the substance.</li>
              <li>
                Using the substance to the point that it interferes with home,
                school, or work responsibilities.
              </li>
              <li>
                Regularly using the substance despite interpersonal difficulties
                that are caused or worsened by the substance.
              </li>
              <li>
                Habitually using the substance in dangerous situations, for
                example, driving a vehicle.
              </li>
              <li>
                Requiring more and more of the substance to feel the desired
                effects or feeling less of a 'high' when using the same amount
                (tolerance).
              </li>
              <li>
                Experiencing withdrawal symptoms when stopping use of the
                substance, or continuing use of the substance to avoid
                withdrawal symptoms.
              </li>
              <li>
                Abandoning significant activities or hobbies in favor of using
                the substance.
              </li>
            </ul>

              If this sounds like you, I can help. With nearly 10 years of
              experience as an addiction counselor in clinical settings, I can
              teach you how to manage your cravings and learn alternative coping
              strategies. I also utilize an EMDR protocol known as DeTur,
              devised by Popky, which can help to desensitize the triggers that
              often lead to substance use. Additionally, I employ Dr. Robert
              Miller's Feeling State Addiction Protocol to break the fixation
              between feeling and behavior.

            <p>
              Trauma-Informed Care/Practice is a strengths-based framework
              founded on five core principles:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Safety</li>
              <li>Trustworthiness</li>
              <li>Choice</li>
              <li>Collaboration</li>
              <li>Empowerment â€“ as well as respect to diversity</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              As a trauma-informed counselor, I take every precaution to do no
              harm or to re-traumatize the person with whom I am working. I see
              the survivor of trauma as a unique person who has experienced
              extremely abnormal situations and has managed as best they could.

          <div class="trauma-section" id="dissociation">
            <h2>Dissociation</h2>
            <p>
              EMDR can be useful for treating dissociative disorders.
              Dissociation is a healthy adaptive defense used almost universally
              by people in response to overwhelming stress or life-threatening
              danger. However, most people experience mild dissociative symptoms
              at times when their lives are not in immediate danger.
            </p>
            <p>
              Dissociation can be viewed as running along a continuum; such as
              losing track of time when you're immersed in a good novel to
              avoiding distress completely by not letting anyone or anything
              affect you or cause you to feel your feelings.
            </p>
            <p>
              A questionnaire is usually given at the start of therapy to screen
              for dissociative disorders. People with dissociative disorders
              don't feel integrated but instead feel somewhat fragmented because
              they have memories, feelings, thoughts, and behaviors that are
              experienced as uncharacteristic and foreign.
            </p>
            <p>
              These divided senses of self and response patterns are called
              dissociative parts of the personality. People who have suffered
              trauma, especially when it occurs in childhood, are more likely to
              experience high levels of dissociation.
            </p>
            <p>
              EMDR can be used to effectively integrate the parts of the self.
              However, when processing traumatic memories in a dissociative
              person, a good deal of preparation needs to take place in order to
              manage the dissociation and stabilize the person beforehand.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ego state therapy using EMDR can be useful to improve a sense of
              inner connectedness so that ego states are working together
              instead of against each other in conflict.
