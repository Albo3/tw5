## How to Edit Text in HTML Files

### Introduction

This guide will help you make basic text edits to your website's HTML files. You can do this directly from this GitHub repository using GitHub's built-in editor.

### Steps to Edit Text

1. **Open the HTML File You Want to Edit**:

   - In the repository, you'll see a list of files and folders.
   - Click on the file you want to edit (e.g., `index.html` for the homepage, `contact.html` for the contact page).

2. **Edit the File**:

   - After clicking the file, click the pencil icon in the top-right corner of the file view. This opens the file in edit mode.
   - You'll see a lot of code, but don't worry! Look for the text you want to changeâ€”it will be between `<p>`, `<h1>`, `<h2>`, or other tags. For example:

     ```html
     <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
     ```

     If you want to change "Welcome to My Website" to something else, just edit the text inside the tags:

     ```html
     <h1>Edit the text</h1>
     ```

3. **Save Your Changes**:
   - Once you've made your changes, scroll down to the bottom of the page.
   - You'll see a "Commit changes" section. In the "Commit message" field, describe what you changed (e.g., "Updated homepage title").
   - Make sure the "Commit directly to the `main` branch" option is selected.
   - Click the green "Commit changes" button.

### Important Notes

- **Backup**: Always double-check before saving your changes. It's easy to undo mistakes, but it's better to avoid them.
- **Formatting**: Be careful not to delete any tags (like `<h1>`, `<p>`, etc.), as this might affect the page's layout.
- **Contact for Help**: If you're unsure about anything or accidentally delete something important, feel free to reach out to me.
